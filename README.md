An experimental information scraper for Saltybet.com

If you're someone other than me (victor kruger) it will be difficult to run this as there is a specific back-end server that is required. and no i'm not letting others access it.

This information is for my own sanity when i want to migrate this package to a different computer.

Requires nodejs v16 LTS or possibly greater, only tested on LTS.

Once installed you will need to run:
 npm install mysql2

finally npm start.
